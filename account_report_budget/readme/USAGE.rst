The P&L report is available at Accounting app > Reporting > US GAAP > Profit & Loss.

Data selection options available are:

    * Period: Month, Quarter, Year, etc.
    * Comparisons: compare to previous periods
    * Journals
    * Analytic Account, to filter numbers by a specific segment

The standard report only presents the actual amount.

Two new columns are now available with:

    * Budget amount: sum the values from VALIDATED Budgets, for the Budgetary positions with a name matching the report line account number. If an Analytic Account is selected, it will filter by it.
    * Variance amount: the difference between the actual amount and the budgeted amount.
